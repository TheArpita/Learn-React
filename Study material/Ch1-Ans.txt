##Library and Framework:

goal of the both is same-
- out of box functions available.
- optimising work load.
- reducing room for error.
- both are bocks of code developed by third parties to solve common problems in a particular programming language.

technical differences-
1. use of queries:
	Library- programmer decides when and where to call
	Framework- framework dictates that
2. Functionality/structural:
	Library- precisely and specifically defined.
	Framework- special kind of library that does not contain “finished” functions, provide the blueprint but not the finished unit.
3. Calling:
	Library- main code calls when needed
	Framework- calls the main code and ask the necessary supplements(if needed).


##CDN(Content Delivery Network):

- to for alleviate the performance bottlenecks.


##React naming: the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.


##crossorigin in <script>:
to use resources from other origin, generally browser will block any acess process with different origins.


##React and ReactDom:
 React: responsible for creating React elements
 ReactDOM: responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM


***class is a reserved property in JavaScript, so className is added in props property of React element.


##react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN:

react.production.js - Minified and optimized production versions of React.


##async and defer:

executing of HTML code and fetching script is happend parallelly(asynchronously) in both the cases.
async- executing of script starts after completion of fetching script
defer- executing of script starts only after execution of HTML code.

## Class based React component- render() is mendetory, this () return some jsx
    constructor - called once at the begining, best place to create state
    never mutate state directly.(never do this.state = ...)
    within seState(), it's only do partial state variable update
    best place for api call - componentDidMount ()
##React life cycle methods- constructor, render, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount
###React lifecycles:-
1. mounting - 
    a) render phase- pure, no side effects. constructor, render
    b) commit phase- work with DOM. componentDidMount
2. updating -
    a) change in state or props, or forced changed - rerender
    b) componentDidUpdate
3. unmounting - when component is just about to unmount from DOM
    a) componentWillUnmount
## componentDidMount can be async but useEffect can't be
